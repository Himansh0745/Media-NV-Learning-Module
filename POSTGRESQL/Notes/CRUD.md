🔹 WHAT IS CRUD?
📌 Definition

CRUD represents the four basic operations performed on data stored in a database:

Operation	      SQL            Keyword Meaning

Create	         INSERT	           Add new data
Read	         SELECT	           Fetch data
Update	         UPDATE	       Modify existing data
Delete	         DELETE	           Remove data
